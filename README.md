# Description
Piper is used to control the state of a machine allowing machines to be built in subsystems in a modular way. Piper-based systems divide the functions of a machine into modules, each with their own task. Each moduleâ€™s behavior is defined using a common set of machine states per the PackML standard.

For more documentation and examples, see https://loupeteam.github.io/LoupeDocs/libraries/piper.html
